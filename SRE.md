### Capacity Planning:

Scenario: You notice a steady increase in traffic to your services. How would you approach capacity planning to ensure that your infrastructure scales effectively?
Follow-up: How do you balance over-provisioning and under-provisioning?

### Monitoring and Observability:

Scenario: A service is intermittently failing, but no clear error messages are being logged. How would you improve the monitoring and observability of this service to diagnose and fix the issue?
Follow-up: Which tools and metrics would you prioritize?

### Reliability vs. Feature Velocity:

Scenario: Product management is pushing for rapid deployment of new features, but you have concerns about the reliability of the current infrastructure. How would you handle this situation and ensure a balance between reliability and feature velocity?

### Incident Management:

Scenario: A critical service is down, and users are experiencing significant disruptions. Walk me through your incident response process from detection to resolution.

Follow-up: How do you ensure communication with stakeholders during and after the incident?

### Disaster Recovery:

Scenario: A natural disaster impacts one of your data centers, causing a complete outage. How would you design and implement a disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss?

Follow-up: What are the key components of a robust disaster recovery strategy?
Automation and Efficiency:

Scenario: Your team is spending a significant amount of time on repetitive manual tasks. How would you identify opportunities for automation, and what steps would you take to implement automation solutions?

Follow-up: Can you provide an example of a successful automation project you led?
### Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
Scenario: Your team needs to define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a new service. How would you approach setting these SLOs, and what factors would you consider to ensure they are both realistic and challenging?

Follow-up: How do you measure and report on SLOs?

### Cost Optimization:

Scenario: The infrastructure costs for your services are increasing rapidly. How would you approach cost optimization while maintaining service reliability?

Follow-up: What strategies and tools would you use to identify and reduce unnecessary costs?

### Security and Compliance:

Scenario: A vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library used by one of your critical services. How would you address this issue to ensure the service remains secure and compliant with relevant standards?

Follow-up: What processes do you have in place to manage and mitigate security risks?

### Post-Mortem Analysis:

Scenario: After resolving a major incident, how would you conduct a post-mortem analysis? 
What steps would you take to ensure that the root cause is identified and similar issues are prevented in the future?
