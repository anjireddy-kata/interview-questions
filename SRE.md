### Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
Scenario: Your team needs to define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a new service. How would you approach setting these SLOs, and what factors would you consider to ensure they are both realistic and challenging?

Follow-up: How do you measure and report on SLOs?

### Cost Optimization:

Scenario: The infrastructure costs for your services are increasing rapidly. How would you approach cost optimization while maintaining service reliability?

Follow-up: What strategies and tools would you use to identify and reduce unnecessary costs?

### Security and Compliance:

Scenario: A vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library used by one of your critical services. How would you address this issue to ensure the service remains secure and compliant with relevant standards?

Follow-up: What processes do you have in place to manage and mitigate security risks?

### Post-Mortem Analysis:

Scenario: How would you conduct a post-mortem analysis after resolving a major incident? 
What steps would you take to ensure that the root cause is identified and similar issues are prevented in the future?

## Resiliency and Fault Tolerance
### Service Failure Handling:

Scenario: One of your microservices fails unexpectedly. How do you ensure that the failure does not cascade and affect other services in the system?
Follow-up: What specific patterns or tools do you use to achieve this?

### Circuit Breaker Implementation:

Scenario: You notice that one of your dependent services is intermittently failing, causing slowdowns and timeouts in your system. How would you implement a circuit breaker pattern to handle this?
Follow-up: How do you determine the thresholds for opening and closing the circuit?
### Graceful Degradation:

Scenario: A critical third-party API that your service relies on is experiencing issues. How would you design your service to degrade gracefully in such a situation?
Follow-up: Can you give an example of a feature that could be degraded while maintaining overall service functionality?

### Health Checks and Monitoring:

Scenario: You need to ensure that all your microservices are running smoothly and are healthy. How would you set up health checks and monitoring for this?
Follow-up: What metrics and tools would you prioritize for effective monitoring?

### Load Balancing:

Scenario: Your microservices are experiencing uneven load distribution, causing some instances to be overloaded while others are underutilized. How would you address this issue?
Follow-up: What load-balancing strategies and technologies do you recommend?

### State Management:

Scenario: You have a stateful microservice that needs to maintain user session data. How do you ensure reliability and fault tolerance for state management in this service?
Follow-up: What approaches or tools would you use to manage state in a distributed environment?

### Data Consistency:

Scenario: Your microservices need to maintain data consistency across different services and databases. How would you handle eventual consistency and ensure data reliability?
Follow-up: How do you deal with data conflicts and ensure data integrity?

### Service Discovery:

Scenario: You are managing a large number of microservices that need to communicate with each other. How would you implement a reliable and fault-tolerant service discovery mechanism?
Follow-up: What tools or frameworks have you used for service discovery?

### Redundancy and Failover:

Scenario: One of your microservices runs on a single instance and you need to ensure high availability. How would you implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for this service?
Follow-up: What considerations do you take into account when designing failover strategies?

### Chaos Engineering:

Scenario: To test the reliability and fault tolerance of your microservices, you decide to implement chaos engineering practices. How would you design and execute chaos experiments?
Follow-up: How do you measure the impact of these experiments and ensure they do not cause significant disruptions?
