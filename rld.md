# Q1: Agent and Call Assignment
Write a program to assign the calls to the available agents. Agents will have a skill level based on their proficiency. The call also contains the priority. 
The highest priority calls required to be assigned to the agents.

### Agent 
| Agent Code  | Skill Level  |
|---|---|
| A1  |  1 |
| A2  |  4 |
| A3  |  5 |

### Calls 
| Call  | Priority  |
|---|---|
| C1  |  10 |
| C2  |  4 |
| C3  |  5 |

Ans: Priority Queues with a Simple Assignment Algorithm.

# Q2: Write a program to store the menu options and play the selected menu option. A menu option has to be extracted at millisecond latency, and a menu may have max of two additional options.

Ans: Binary Search Tree 

# Q3 : Write a program to identify potential fraudulent callers by matching phone numbers against known blacklists.
Ans: Hashmap

# Q4: Given an expression containing numeric operands with addition and subtraction operators, evaluate it. Assume that the expression is valid and may contain sub-expressions enclosed in opening and closing braces.
Input: s = -10+(5+(12+8)-2)+1 Output: 14

# Q5: Implement a simple spell checker with auto completion of words
Ans: Tries required to be used here.

# Q6: Find total ways to reach the nâ€™th stair from the bottom. 
Given a staircase, find the total number of ways to reach the n'th stair from the bottom of the stair when a person can only climb either 1 or 2 or 3 stairs at a time.

Total ways to reach the 3rd stair are 4

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps 
2 steps + 1 step 
3 steps

# Q17: I have one million items in an array. I would like to do the range searches. What data structure would be best fit here.
For range searches on a large dataset with one million items, you'll want a data structure that allows efficient querying of items falling within a specified range. One suitable data structure for this purpose is an Interval Tree or a Segment Tree. These structures are particularly well-suited for range queries and can significantly speed up range search operations.

Interval Tree:

An Interval Tree is a data structure specifically designed for storing and querying intervals (ranges).
Each node in the tree represents an interval, and the tree is constructed in such a way that it efficiently handles queries for overlapping intervals.
Range searches, such as finding all intervals that overlap with a given range, can be performed in O(log n + k) time, where n is the number of intervals and k is the number of intervals in the result set.
Segment Tree:

A Segment Tree is a versatile data structure that can be used for various types of range queries, including minimum, maximum, sum, and more.
While it's not designed exclusively for interval queries, it can be adapted to handle them efficiently.
Range queries can be performed in O(log n) time.
When choosing between an Interval Tree and a Segment Tree, consider the specific requirements of your application:

If your primary concern is efficiently handling range queries on intervals, an Interval Tree is a dedicated structure for this purpose.
If you anticipate needing to perform other types of range queries (e.g., finding the minimum or maximum value within a range), a Segment Tree offers more flexibility.
Keep in mind that building and maintaining these trees can have some overhead in terms of memory and preprocessing time, especially when dealing with a large dataset like one million items. However, the efficiency gains during range searches often outweigh these costs.

Additionally, if your range queries are static (i.e., the dataset doesn't change frequently), you might consider constructing a tree once and then querying it multiple times, which can amortize the initial construction cost over multiple queries.
