# Q1: Agent and Call Assignment
Write a program to assign the calls to the available agents. Agents will have a skill level based on their proficiency. The call also contains the priority. 
The highest priority calls required to be assigned to the agents.

### Agent 
| Agent Code  | Skill Level  |
|---|---|
| A1  |  1 |
| A2  |  4 |
| A3  |  5 |

### Calls 
| Call  | Priority  |
|---|---|
| C1  |  10 |
| C2  |  4 |
| C3  |  5 |

Ans: Priority Queues with a Simple Assignment Algorithm.

# Q2: Write a program to store the menu options and play the selected menu option. A menu option has to be extracted at millisecond latency, and a menu may have max of two additional options.

Ans: Binary Search Tree 

# Q3 : Write a program to identify potential fraudulent callers by matching phone numbers against known blacklists.
Ans: Hashmap

# Q4: Given an expression containing numeric operands with addition and subtraction operators, evaluate it. Assume that the expression is valid and may contain sub-expressions enclosed in opening and closing braces.
Input: s = -10+(5+(12+8)-2)+1 Output: 14

# Q5: Implement a simple spell checker with auto completion of words
Ans: Tries required to be used here.

# Q6: Find total ways to reach the nâ€™th stair from the bottom. 
Given a staircase, find the total number of ways to reach the n'th stair from the bottom of the stair when a person can only climb either 1 or 2 or 3 stairs at a time.

Total ways to reach the 3rd stair are 4

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps 
2 steps + 1 step 
3 steps
