Q1: write a price optimizing algorithm for a shopping website. Given an array of prices and a budget, find all pairs of items that the customer can buy whose combined price does not exceed the budget.
Q2: Find the first non-repeating character in a string by doing only one traversal of it
Input: string is ABCDBAGHC Output: The first non-repeating character in the string is D
Q3: Write a algorithm to map taxi-drivers and customers. Please note that, wen customers are prime members teir requests should serve first
Q4: write a program to build file recovery tool. Implement a solution to recover files in order of their deletion time.
Q5: In an e-commerce system, customers can add and remove items from their shopping cart, but they also want to undo the last added item. 
Implement a solution that allows adding, removing, and undoing the last operation.
Q6: write a algorithm to map incoming calls to the agents. customers are categorized as prime and economy customers.
However, customers who have waited the longest must be attended first with in a specific category. 
Q7: Develop a spell-checker for a word processing app with autocomplete options (tries).
Q8: In a ride-sharing app, drivers bid for customers. Each bid has a price and a time of submission.
Implement a heap-based solution to always assign the customer to the driver with the lowest bid. 
Q9: In a movie streaming app, users can view a list of top-rated movies. Implement a system that efficiently maintains the top 10 highest-rated movies at all times
Q10: Implement a solution to find all possible routes from a source to a destination airport.
Q11: Given an expression containing numeric operands with addition and subtraction operators, evaluate it. Assume that the expression is valid and may contain sub-expressions enclosed in opening and closing braces.
Input: s = -15-2+1 Output: -16
Input: s = -10+(5+(12+8)-2)+1 Output: 14
q12: Implement a rate limiter
q13: Given a string, find the first k non-repeating characters in it by doing only a single traversal of it.
For example, if the string is ABCDBAGHCHFAC and k = 3, the output would be 'D', 'G', 'F'.
q14: Given a staircase, find the total number of ways to reach the n'th stair from the bottom of the stair when a person can only climb either 1 or 2 or 3 stairs at a time.
Total ways to reach the 3rd stair are 4
1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step, 2 steps 2 steps , 1 step 3 steps
q15: implement an algorithm to validate the product availability and timely order fulfillment.
