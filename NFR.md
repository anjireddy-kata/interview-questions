## User Interface nad Human Factors
* What type of user will be using the system?
* Will more than one type of user be using the system?
* What sort of training will be required for each type of user?
* Is it particularly important that the system be easy to learn?
* Is it particularly important that users be protected from making errors?
* What sort of input/output devices for the human interface are available and what are their characteristics?
## Documentation
* What kind of documentation is required?
* What audience is to be addressed by each document?
* Hardware Considerations
* What hardware is the proposed system to be used on?
* What are the characteristics of the target hardware, including memory size and auxiliary storage space?
## Performance Characteristics
* Are there any speed, throughput, or response time constraints on the system?
* Are there size or capacity constraints on the data to be processed by the system?
## Error Handling and Extreme Conditions
* How should the system respond to input errors?
* How should the system respond to extreme conditions?
## System Interfacing
* Is input coming from systems outside the proposed system?
* Is output going to systems outside the proposed system?
* Are there restrictions on the format or medium that must be used for input or output?
# Quality Issues
* What are the requirements for reliability?
* Must the system trap faults?
* Is there a maximum acceptable time for restarting the system after a failure?
* What is the acceptable system downtime per 24-hour period?
* Is it important that the system be portable (able to move to different hardware or operating system environments)?
## System Modifications
* What parts of the system are likely candidates for later modification?
* What sorts of modifications are expected?
## Physical Environment
* Where will the target equipment operate?
* Will the target equipment be in one or several locations?
* Will the environmental conditions in any way be out of the ordinary (for example, unusual temperatures, vibration, magnetic fields)?
## Security Issues
* Must access to any data or the system itself be controlled?
* Is physical security an issue?
## Resources and Management Issues
* How often will the system be backed up?
* Who will be responsible for the back up?
* Who is responsible for system installation?
* Who will be responsible for system maintenance?
