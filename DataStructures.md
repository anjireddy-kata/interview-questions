# Q1: Given two integer arrays(arr1 and arr2) of equal length, Check if the given arrays are equal or not.

Problem Note 

Two arrays are said to be equal if they contain the same set of elements, but the permutations of the elements may differ. 

If there is a repetition of any element in the arrays, then the count of that element must be the same in both the arrays to be equal. 

If the arrays are equal, the output will be 1, else the output will be 0.  

Input: arr1[] = [1,4,6,8] , arr2[] = [8,1,6,4]   
Output: 1 
Explanation: There is no repetion of any element in the arrays, and both contains same set of elements. Hence, the output is 1. 

# Q2: Find the first non-repeating character in a string by doing only one traversal of it 

Input: 
 
string is ABCDBAGHC 
 
Output: 
 
The first non-repeating character in the string is D
