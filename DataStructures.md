# Q1: Given two integer arrays(arr1 and arr2) of equal length, Check if the given arrays are equal or not.

Problem Note 

Two arrays are said to be equal if they contain the same set of elements, but the permutations of the elements may differ. 

If there is a repetition of any element in the arrays, then the count of that element must be the same in both arrays to be equal. 

If the arrays are equal, the output will be 1, otherwise, the output will be 0.  

Input: arr1[] = [1,4,6,8] , arr2[] = [8,1,6,4]   
Output: 1 
Explanation: There is no repetition of any element in the arrays, and both contain the same set of elements. Hence, the output is 1. 

# Q2: Find the first non-repeating character in a string by doing only one traversal of it 

Input: 
 
string is ABCDBAGHC 
 
Output: 
 
The first non-repeating character in the string is D

# Q3: For a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of the target string in the source string. If the target does not exist in the source, return -1 .

 if source="source" and target = "target", return -1
 if source = "abcdabcdefg" and target="bcd" then return 1

 # Q4: Find all distinct combinations of a given length that sum to a target.

 Given a positive integer n and a target, find all combinations of distinct numbers in the interval [1,9] of length n that add up to the target.
 Input: n = 4, target = 10
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: The sum of all the elements in [1, 2, 3, 4] is 10. Only one combination is possible, since numbers cannot be repeated.

# Q5:Determine whether an array can be divided into pairs with a sum divisible by `k`
Given an integer array, determine whether it can be divided into pairs such that the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by a given positive integer k.

# Q6: Find the first `k` non-repeating characters in a string in a single traversal
Given a string, find the first k non-repeating characters in it by doing only a single traversal of it.

For example, if the string is ABCDBAGHCHFAC and k = 3, the output would be 'D', 'G', 'F'.

# Q7: Find the minimum index of a repeating element in an array

Input:  { 5, 6, 3, 4, 3, 6, 4 }
Output: The minimum index of the repeating element is 1

Input:  { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
Output: Invalid Input

# Q8: Recursive solution to sort a stack
Given a stack, sort it using recursion. The use of any other data structures (like containers in STL or Collections in Java) is not allowed.

# Q11: Check if an expression is balanced or not
Given a string containing opening and closing braces, check if it represents a balanced expression or not.
{[{}{}]}[()], {{}{}}, []{}() are balanced expressions.
 
{()}[), {(}) are not balanced.
